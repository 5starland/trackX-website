These Terms of Use, along with our Privacy Policy, govern your use of the mobile applications (the “Application”) and related services provided by Hangzhou Xinglu Network Information Technology Co., Ltd (“Us,” “We”). By downloading and using the Application, you agree to these Terms of Use. Continued use signifies that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, do not use the Application.

### Interpretation

The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.



### Service Description

The App is a tool that enables you to create content (“User Content”), by yourself and based on your Content (the User Content) and to download the result.

AI Stem Separation: Instantly split any audio file or real-time recording into 6 isolated tracks with studio-grade precision.

Professional Editing Tools: Adjust stem volumes, change pitch/tempo without distortion, trim samples, and export in WAV/FLAC/MP3/MIDI formats.

Multi-Source Integration: Process audio from your device library, YouTube, SoundCloud, or live recordings (microphone input).

### Intellectual Property

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to access and use the app strictly for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms. All intellectual property rights in the app, including its software architecture, source code, graphics, user interface, trademarks, slogans, domain names, databases, and all related content (collectively, the "Protected Elements") remain the exclusive property of us and its licensors. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as transferring any intellectual property rights to you. You expressly agree not to modify, reverse engineer, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or create derivative works based on the app or any Protected Elements, nor use them for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent. Any unauthorized use of the Protected Elements constitutes copyright infringement and may result in immediate termination of your access to the app and further legal action.

### Warranties 

You warrant that all uploaded/processed audio is lawfully owned by you (e.g., no copyrighted music without authorization). Your User Content, or any part of it, is a content on which you have all the rights, licenses, consents and approvals required to use and license. Your User Content does not violate rights of third parties including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, performers' rights, privacy or advertising rights, or rights related to confidential information. Your User Content does not include offensive language, especially of a racial or discriminatory nature.

Separated stems may only be used for personal, non-commercial purposes.

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless our company and other users from any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your violation of third-party rights through use of the app.



### Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer

The app utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to provide audio processing and music analysis services. You acknowledge and agree that:

Experimental Nature: The AI/ML technology powering the app is rapidly evolving and may produce unexpected or imperfect results, including but not limited to errors in stem separation, chord detection, beat tracking, or lyric recognition.

Accuracy Limitations: Generated outputs (e.g., separated stems, chords, lyrics, or metadata) may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or misrepresentations of the original audio content.

Offensive Content Risk: Due to the nature of AI, processed content may inadvertently include offensive, inappropriate, or nonsensical material. The app does not filter or moderate such outputs.

No Liability: We disclaim all liability for any harm, loss, or claims arising from your reliance on AI-generated content. You assume full responsibility for verifying the accuracy and appropriateness of all outputs.

Indemnification: You agree to indemnify and hold our company harmless against any claims related to your use (or misuse) of AI-processed content.



Your use of the app’s AI features is at your sole discretion and risk.

### License Restrictions

You may not, except where expressly permitted by applicable law:

(a) Copy, redistribute, publicly perform, or create derivative works based on the app's service or its content;

(b) Alter, modify, or reverse engineer any portion of the application;

(c) Bypass, disable, or interfere with any security features or access controls of the Service.



Your right to use the application is immediately revoked if such use violates any applicable laws or regulations.



### Third-Party Services and External Links

The application may integrate with or provide tools to connect with third-party services, allowing you to import or export content between these platforms and our app. By using these features, you authorize  the application to transfer your information (including any user-generated content) to the designated third-party service. Please note:

Third-party services operate independently from the application, and we do not control or assume responsibility for their handling of your data or content.

You are solely responsible for ensuring you have all necessary rights and permissions to share content through these integrations.

The app may contain links to external websites, whose content and practices are beyond our control.

We strongly advise reviewing the terms and privacy policies of any third-party service before connecting it with the application.

Once information is shared with a third-party service,  the application cannot retrieve or control its subsequent use. Your interactions with third-party services are governed by their respective terms, not by this agreement.



### Limitation of Liability

The application is designed for personal, non-commercial use only. To the fullest extent permitted by law, our company shall not be liable for:

Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the application, including but not limited to data loss, business interruption, lost revenue, reputational harm, or missed opportunities;

Service interruptions, technical failures, or inability to access the app;

Security incidents including unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, or other risks inherent to internet-based services.



While we implement industry-standard security measures, we cannot guarantee complete protection against all cyber threats. You acknowledge that using the application involves inherent risks associated with online services and agree to assume full responsibility for any consequences resulting from such risks.

### Subscription

The subscription auto-renews 24 hours before the current period ends, at the same price and for the same duration as the original subscription.
