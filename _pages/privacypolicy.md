# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 2025**



Hangzhou Xinglu Network Information Technology Co., Ltd (“we”) has developed our products and services. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and share data through our products and services and we refer to these together as the “Apps”. We reserve the right to and may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you through the Apps, or by presenting you with a new version of this Privacy Policy for you to accept, if we, for example, add new processing activities or collect some additional Personal Data from you. Please also periodically check back for updates. You can see the last updated date for this Privacy Policy at the bottom of the policy. We provide you with this Privacy Policy to make our users aware of the steps we take to ensure the security of their data when utilizing the Apps. This policy describes the types of information we collect when you use the Apps, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to privacy. By using the Apps, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information when you use the application:

(a) Information You Provide Directly

When you create an account, we collect your email address and username to authenticate and personalize your experience.

When you upload or record audio files, we process and store this content to provide our core separation and analysis features.

If you purchase premium features, we collect payment information through secure third-party processors (e.g., Apple Pay).



(b) Usage and Technical Data

We automatically collect your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type (e.g., iPhone 14), iOS version, and mobile browser type to optimize app performance.

When you use the application, we log which features you access (e.g., stem separation, chord detection), processing duration, and interaction patterns to improve our services.

Diagnostic data such as crash reports and performance metrics help us identify and resolve technical issues.



(c) Audio Processing Data

For every audio file you process, we extract metadata including duration, sample rate, and file format to enable accurate analysis.

The AI generates and temporarily stores derived data (isolated stems, detected chords, beat maps) to deliver your requested results.



(d) Mobile-Specific Data

If you access the application via our iOS app, we collect your device's unique identifier, operating system version, and network information to ensure compatibility.

We record timestamps of your sessions and feature usage frequency to understand engagement patterns.

### Use of Your Personal Data

We processes your personal data to provide, improve, and secure the app's service, as well as to fulfill legal obligations and business needs. Specifically, we use your information for the following purposes:

Service Provision & Account Management: To authenticate your account, enable app functionalities (e.g., audio processing, chord detection), and monitor service usage for performance optimization.

Contractual Obligations: To execute purchases of premium features, process subscriptions, and enforce our Terms of Service.

Communication: To send you essential notifications (e.g., security updates, feature changes) via email, in-app alerts, or SMS. With your consent, we may also share promotional offers or news about similar services.

User Support: To respond to your inquiries, troubleshoot issues, and manage feature requests.

Business Operations: For internal analytics (e.g., tracking feature popularity, crash diagnostics), service improvements, and corporate transactions (e.g., mergers, asset sales), where user data may be transferred as part of our business assets.

### Data Sharing Circumstances

We only share personal data under strict conditions:

Service Providers: With trusted vendors (e.g., cloud hosting, payment processors) bound by confidentiality agreements.

Legal Compliance: To comply with court orders, fraud investigations, or regulatory requirements.

Business Transfers: In connection with mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcy proceedings.

User-Driven Sharing: When you voluntarily interact with other users (e.g., shared playlists) or consent to third-party integrations (e.g., social media).

We never sell your audio content or usage data to third-party advertisers.

### Data Retention Policy

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill these purposes:

Active Use Period: Your account data and processed audio content are maintained while you remain an active user of the app.

Legal Requirements: We preserve certain information (e.g., payment records, consent history) to comply with tax, financial, and other regulatory obligations.

Dispute Resolution: Data relevant to ongoing customer support cases or legal disputes may be retained until final resolution.



Usage statistics and diagnostic information are typically stored for shorter durations. All retained data is securely isolated with restricted access. You may request early deletion of non-essential records through your account settings or by contacting our support team.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.

### Data Disclosure & Security

Your personal data may be disclosed in specific circumstances: 

(1) Business transfers – if the company undergoes a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, we will notify you before your data becomes subject to new policies; (2) Legal compliance – when required by law enforcement, court orders, or government requests; or (3) Protection purposes – to defend our legal rights, investigate potential misconduct, or ensure user/public safety. While we implement industry-standard security measures (including encryption and access controls), no digital system is completely immune to risks. We continuously monitor and update our protections, but cannot guarantee absolute security against unforeseen breaches. You can enhance safety by using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.

### Links

The application may display third-party advertisements and links to external websites. Please note:

These content and services operate independently from the apop, and we do not endorse or control their privacy practices.

When you interact with third-party ads or links, any data you provide will be governed by their respective privacy policies, not by the app's.

We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party services before engaging with them.

### Privacy Policy Updates

We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make material changes, we will:

Post the revised policy on this page with an updated "Last Revised" date

Provide advance notice through in-app alerts and/or email (for significant changes)



We encourage you to periodically review this policy to stay informed about how we protect your information. All updates become effective immediately upon posting unless otherwise stated.
